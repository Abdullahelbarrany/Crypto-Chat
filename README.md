# Crypto-Chat
A socket-based chatting app with AES, DES, RSA, and ElGamal encryption methods, enhanced by Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure communication between clients on separate laptops
SafeComm - Secure Chatting App with Multiple Encryption Methods

SafeComm is a secure chatting application designed to facilitate encrypted communication between two clients on different laptops. The app utilizes socket programming to establish a reliable connection between the clients and employs four robust encryption methods: AES, DES, RSA, and ElGamal. By leveraging these encryption algorithms, SafeComm ensures that the messages exchanged between users remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

To enhance security further, SafeComm incorporates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to generate a unique session ID for each chat session. This session ID acts as a shared secret key between the clients, enabling them to encrypt and decrypt their messages securely throughout the conversation.

Key Features:

Socket-based communication between clients on separate laptops.
Robust encryption methods: AES, DES, RSA, and ElGamal.
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for session ID generation.
Confidential and secure messaging to safeguard user privacy.
With SafeComm, you can chat with confidence, knowing that your conversations are shielded by multiple encryption layers, making it challenging for malicious actors to intercept or decipher your messages
